            <h2>How to Tell If Bread is Still Edible</h2>
            <p>
                Bread is a staple food in many households, but it can quickly go stale or moldy if not stored properly. Here’s how to determine if your bread is still good to eat:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check for mold: Look for green or black spots. If you see any, discard the bread.</li>
                <li>Smell it: If it smells sour or off, it’s no longer safe to eat.</li>
                <li>Feel the texture: Stale bread is dry and hard but still edible if there’s no mold. You can revive it by heating it slightly in an oven.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Store your bread in a cool, dry place or freeze it to extend its shelf life.</p>

            <h2>How to Check If Milk is Still Good</h2>
            <p>
                Milk is another commonly wasted food item. Use these tips to check if your milk is still drinkable:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smell it: Fresh milk has a neutral smell. If it smells sour or unpleasant, it has likely spoiled.</li>
                <li>Check the texture: If the milk appears lumpy or curdled, it is no longer safe to consume.</li>
                <li>Taste a small amount: If unsure, taste a tiny amount. If it tastes sour, don’t consume it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Store milk at or below 4°C (40°F) to keep it fresh longer.</p>
